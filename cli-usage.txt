drive-to-tape [-hr --help --replace] [-l|log ./path] [-v|verbosity DEBUG|INFO|WARN|ERROR] [source] [target]

  source: 

    A path to a file. Converts the specified file to a tape test.
    If absent, reads from stdin.

  target: 

    A file. The results of conversion are placed in the specified file. If
    absent, the results are piped to stdout instead.

  -h, --help

    Print this help message and exit.

  -l, --log /path

    A relative (meaning leading with a ./) or absolute path to the files into
    which logs should be placed.
    
  -v, --verbosity "DEBUG|INFO|WARN|ERROR"

    Set the log level to the specified verbosity. Messages of the same or
    greater severity are printed to the log. Defaults to WARN.

    ERROR: Print errors encountered during parsing
    WARN:  html or endpoints function encountered in the drive file are
           recorded to the log
    INFO:  Progress updates, transformation steps are printed to the log.
    DEBUG: Same as WARN at current.

  -r, --replace

    Runs the transformation in-place-- the results are written back to the input
    file rather than output.
