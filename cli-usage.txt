drive-to-tape source target

  source: 

    A file or directory. If a file, converts the specified file to a tape test.
    If absent, reads from stdin.If a directory, recursively descends the
    directory, converting each file matching *.test.js to a tape test, which it
    places in target/*.js, making new directories where necessary. 

  target: 

    A file or directory. If a directory, the results of conversion are placed
    in the directory. If a filename, the results of conversion are placed in
    the specified file.
